    <h1>Privacy Policy for ShopSwipe</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>ShopSwipe is designed with a "Privacy First" architecture. All shopping list items, pantry data, and quantities are stored locally on your device using Apple’s <strong>SwiftData</strong> framework. We do not maintain external servers, and your shopping data never leaves your device unless you choose to back up your device to iCloud.</p>

    <h2>2. Apple Intelligence & Image Generation</h2>
    <p>ShopSwipe utilizes <strong>Apple Intelligence (ImagePlayground)</strong> to generate custom icons for your items. 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All image generation and text-to-description "Smart Fallbacks" are performed entirely on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> Your item names and descriptions are not shared with us or any third-party AI providers.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Transactions for "ShopSwipe Pro" are processed securely by Apple via the App Store. We do not collect or store your credit card or banking information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because your data is stored locally, you have total control. You can delete your data at any time by:
    <ul>
        <li>Deleting individual items within the app.</li>
        <li>Using the "Clear Cache" button in the App Settings.</li>
        <li>Deleting the ShopSwipe app from your device.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact us at: appshopswipe@fastmail.com</p>
